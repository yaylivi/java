# java
The assignment is:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a SSN in the format DDD-DD-DDDD, where D is a digit.
Your program should check whether the input is valid

The code works if I enter a valid SSN.
My if else statements are obviously not written correctly because I can't figure out how to properly do them, so nothing is outputted when I enter an invalid SSN.
I'm not naturally gifted at this so I'm sure it looks dumb but I'm doing my best

thanks again you're a good friend
